%INTERSECT   Compute the indices of the glue between two patches.
%   [I1, I2, I4A, I4B, L2G1, L2G2, SCL1, SCL2, SCLAB] = INTERSECT(A, B)
%   returns the indices of the glue w.r.t. A.edges and B.edges of two
%   patches A and B. For consistency with the paper by Martinsson:
%
%       I1 : Indices of DOFs on A.edges which are not on B.edges
%       I2 : Indices of DOFs on B.edges which are not on A.edges
%       I4A: Indices of DOFs on A.edges which are in the intersection
%       I4B: Indices of DOFs on B.edges which are in the intersection
%
%   [I1, I2, I4A, I4B, DOM, EDGESAB] = INTERSECT(A, B) returns also the
%   domain and the edges of the intersection.

% The new domain will be NaN except in the special case when we are
% merging two rectangluar patches horizontally or vertically.
dom = NaN;

i4a = [];
for k = 1:numel(iA)
    i4a = [i4a ; ppA(iA(k)) + (1:pA(iA(k))).'];
end

    i4b = [i4b ; ppB(iB(k)) + (1:pB(iB(k))).'];
